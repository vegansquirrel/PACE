    "result": "To calculate the payment amount for the USD 10,000,000 Seven-Year USD Callable Range Accrual Notes linked to the USD SOFR, we need to consider the interest calculation based on the SOFR rates provided.\n\nThe notes are linked to the SOFR, which is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The interest payment for a period is typically calculated using the average SOFR over the relevant period, multiplied by the notional amount, and adjusted for the number of days in the period.\n\nGiven the data provided, we have SOFR rates for the period from January 10, 2025, to February 10, 2025. We will calculate the average SOFR over this period and then determine the interest payment for this period.\n\n1. **Calculate the Average SOFR:**\n   - The SOFR rates provided are mostly 4.35%, with two days at 4.33% and one day at 4.36%.\n   - Total days with SOFR data: 21 business days.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average SOFR} = \\frac{(4.35\\% \\times 18) + (4.33\\% \\times 2) + (4.36\\% \\times 1)}{21}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average SOFR} = \\frac{(78.3 + 8.66 + 4.36)}{21} = \\frac{91.32}{21} \\approx 4.3486\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Interest Payment:**\n   - Notional amount: USD 10,000,000\n   - Average SOFR: 4.3486%\n   - Number of days in the period: 21 business days\n   - Assuming a 360-day year for interest calculation (common in money markets):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest Payment} = \\text{Notional Amount} \\times \\text{Average SOFR} \\times \\frac{\\text{Number of Days}}{360}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest Payment} = 10,000,000 \\times 0.043486 \\times \\frac{21}{360}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Interest Payment} = 10,000,000 \\times 0.043486 \\times 0.0583333 \\approx 25,373.61\n   \\]\n\n**Final Payment Amount:**\n\nThe final payment amount for the interest period from January 10, 2025, to February 10, 2025, is approximately USD 25,373.61."
